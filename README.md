Attempt to remake Skydiver game (originally on Nokia 3510i)

This is my attempt to make a remake of one of my favorite mobile games - Skydiver (Originally in Nokia 3510i)
Goal was to learn how to program 3d engine from scratch. I've managed to write let's say an engine (it has no compare to Unity for example! ;-)) which is able to display any 3d object. Not only flat ones like in this simple proof-of-concept game. But there is still lot to do and learn!
It is written in Python, with pygame. It is not using opengl, or similiar.
